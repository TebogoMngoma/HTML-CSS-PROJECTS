# HTML-CSS-PROJECTS
These are websites/projects that I have built using only HTML5 and CSS. They really helped me understand and user side of a website and learn a lot about features like styling and structure,responsive design ,typography  of a website.
These are beginner's projects with no languages like Javascript ,php or python ,no libraries and no frameworks
